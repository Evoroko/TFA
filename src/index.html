      <p>I tried many commissions platforms but none of them ever convinced me. The fee was too high, and I was drowned in the middle of popular artists, so I switched to Twitter to sell my drawing, until I discovered CommiMe. Thanks to this app, I can now easily find new clients and the process is way easier than before !</p>

      <p>I never dared to sell my drawings, but when I discovered CommiMe, I finally tried it. I don’t regret starting by using it — it was very intuitive and simple, I was guided all along and I didn’t have any doubt on the whole process. Now, my drawings are a part of my income.</p>

      <p>As a commission buyer, I always found it sad that smaller artists were lacking visibilty, and even if you wanted to support them, it wasn’t an easy task to find them in the first place, but with this app, this problem was solved and I can now discover new artists every day.</p>
